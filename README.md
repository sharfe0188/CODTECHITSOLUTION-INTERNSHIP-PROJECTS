 TASK ONE:
 EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)
 Start with a dataset of your choice and perform EDA using libraries like pandas, numpy,
 and matplotlib or seaborn. Explore the data's characteristics, distributions, correlations,
 and outliers. Visualize your findings with histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to
 gain insights into the data.
 TASK TWO:
 PREDICTIVE MODELING WITH LINEAR REGRESSION
 Implement a simple linear regression model using a dataset with continuous
 target variables. Split the data into training and testing sets, train the model on
 the training data, evaluate its performance using metrics like mean squared
 error or R-squared, and make predictions on the test set. Visualize the
 regression line and actual vs. predicted values to assess the model's accuracy

 TASK THREE:PREDICTIVE MODELING WITH CLASSIFICATION
 Utilize a dataset with labeled data and apply classification algorithms to build predictive
 models. Preprocess the data, split it into training and testing sets, and explore various
 classification algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or
 support vector machines. Evaluate the models using metrics like accuracy, precision,
 recall, and F1- score, and compare their performances to determine the most suitabl
